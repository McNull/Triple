A lean and mean utility for managing a triple Window layout (on a 21:9 widescreen).

## Why?
Because I wanted something tiny for something simple.

## Installation
* Download the [Triple.zip](https://github.com/McNull/Triple/raw/master/Dist/Triple.zip) from the [`Dist`](https://github.com/McNull/Triple/tree/master/Dist) folder.
* Unzip to any location
* Doubleclick `install.cmd` (_optional_)
* Doubleclick `triple.exe`

## Usage
Currently the keyboard combos are hardcoded.

* `Windows`+ `Alt` + `Left`: Align to **left side**
* `Windows`+ `Alt` + `Up`: Align to **middle**
* `Windows`+ `Alt` + `Right`: Align to **right side**
